# Visualization and Navigation for Digital Archaeological Data
Development space for data visualization and navigation in large digital collections. Code here are aimed to build visualization tools that are appropriate for archaeology. The code is on an MIT license.

The project uses Open Context's [API services] (https://opencontext.org/about/services) to grab data (GeoJSON). Current focus is on making explicit 'uneven-ness' in digital archaeological collections. The first tool developed here is a visualization filter that enables an archaeologist to exclude data records from a selection or query.
